A practical 2D math/geometry library for functional JavaScript, based on [Ramda](http://ramdajs.com/).

## Why Gama?

Gama is based on Ramda and follows its philosophy. The primary features of Gama are:

- Immutability and side-effect free functions are at the heart of its design philosophy. This can help you get the job done with simple, elegant code.
- Functions are automatically curried. This allows you to easily build up new functions from old ones simply by not supplying the final parameters.

## Installation

```console
npm install gama
```

## Testing

```console
npm install

npm run lint
npm run test
```
